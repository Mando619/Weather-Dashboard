# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another 
application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party
APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making
requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to 
build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature 
dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions. Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## Description

This weather applications helps find the current weather in whichever city you choose. A 5 day display with forcast will show as well. Icons will be displayed to show weather.  When clicking on another city, your recent search will have been saved, adding a button to go back to that city.
